Cloud Architecture | AWS | DevOps | Kubernetes | Automation

I am an AWS Solutions Architect and DevOps Leader based in Riga, Latvia, focused on designing secure, scalable, and cost-efficient cloud architectures for companies across the EU and EMEA. I build highly reliable cloud platforms using AWS, Kubernetes (EKS), Terraform, GitLab CI/CD, GitOps, Crossplane, and DevSecOps, supporting large-scale production workloads.

Key areas of expertise:

• Designing highly available and cost-optimized AWS architectures
• EKS cluster design, EC2 Auto Scaling, Fargate, Lambda serverless workloads
• Multi-account VPC architectures, Transit Gateway networking, Route53, CloudFront, WAF/Shield
• Security-first AWS design: IAM governance, KMS, Secrets Manager, GuardDuty, Config
• Data-layer engineering: S3 lifecycle design, RDS/Aurora optimization, DynamoDB patterns, ElastiCache, backup and DR strategies
• GitOps-driven delivery using GitLab, ArgoCD, Helm, Terraform, and Crossplane
• Observability and governance with CloudWatch, CloudTrail, AWS Config, X-Ray, OpenSearch, Prometheus, and Grafana
• Platform engineering leadership across cloud migrations and modernization initiatives
• Implementing FinOps strategies to reduce cloud spend and optimize compute and storage
• Building reusable IaC modules, platform standards, and automated delivery pipelines

My background includes multi-region AWS architecture design, Kubernetes platform engineering, DevSecOps automation, CI/CD modernization, and leading cross-functional teams to adopt cloud-native patterns.

Certifications: AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA), Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD), KCNA.

I help organizations build and operate scalable AWS platforms, modernize infrastructure, adopt Kubernetes on EKS, implement automation at every layer, and establish secure and cost-optimized cloud environments. I am open to opportunities across the EU, EMEA, and fully remote roles requiring strong AWS and DevOps leadership.

💸 1 TB of iPhone data. €120/year. Stuck with iCloud. Need help.

I'm currently paying €120/year for Apple iCloud (2 TB) because my iPhone data (photos, videos, backups) has grown beyond 1 TB.
I want to stop paying this recurring cost — but I've hit a hard wall.

👉 There is **no** native way to back up an iPhone directly to a NAS (over Wi‑Fi or via NAS apps) with full restore support.
Apple only supports:
• iCloud backups
• Backup via Mac/PC (Finder / iTunes)

A NAS can store backups, but only indirectly (iPhone → computer → NAS).

❓ I need help from the community:

How did you reduce or eliminate iCloud storage costs without risking your data?
• Hybrid NAS + minimal iCloud?
• Third‑party tools?
• Local‑only backups?

Or did you accept the ~€120/year as the price of convenience for seamless backups and restores?

Real-world setups and lessons learned appreciated 🙏

Cloud sustainability is no longer a "nice-to-have" ESG metric—it is a technical constraint for the 2026 SRE. 

I used to think FinOps was the final frontier for EKS optimization. I was wrong. While we were slashing costs by 20-40% using CAST AI, our carbon footprint remained a "black box."

Enter GreenOps: The practice of optimizing cloud resources for carbon efficiency, not just cost. As a DevOps engineer, I’ve realized that a "cheap" cluster isn't always a "green" cluster.

Here is my 4-part framework for migrating from DevOps to GreenOps in EKS:
1. Carbon-Aware Scheduling: Moving workloads to low-carbon AWS regions and hibernating idle pods during peak carbon intensity hours.
2. Pipeline Observability: Integrating CO2 tracking directly into GitLab/CloudWatch—treating carbon as a first-class metric alongside CPU and memory.
3. Green-by-Default GitOps: Using ArgoCD to enforce "lean" manifests that prevent overprovisioning before the first node even scales.
4. The FinOps/GreenOps Loop: Leveraging CAST AI for Spot instances—reducing both the literal cost and the physical waste of idle hardware.
Which metric is your team tracking this quarter: the bill, the footprint, or both?

Ebrahim was one our founder team members. He started making key contributions from the very beginning to the project of building a curated platform on AWS. The main technologies involved are AWS services, Kubernetes, Crossplane, GitLab and the Argo GitOps family. 
He immediately adapted to our high demanding and changing environment and developed Service Catalog and crossplane automations to enable the migrations to the AWS platform. He also led explorations on many technologies including FinOps. The latest successful contribution has been leading the engineers and the conversations with the vendor to integrate CastAI on our platform to deploy on hundreds of EKS clusters. 
Our main mandate is also to transform applications from our internal clouds to the GitOps pattern on our new AWS platform. He did successfully lead several and of one of the most complicated application transformations so far too. These transformations involve adapting the deployment of the application to a GitOps pattern and adding the proper observability to it. 
His key human factors are: transparency, perseverance, collaboration and easiness to work with.

i'm having the pleasure to work with Ibrahim in a big on-premises to AWS migration project.
Ibrahim's knowledge on DevOps, K8S is helpful in doing this work that is not a lift and shift one but also a modernization.
Ibrahim is also testing himself with new approaches based on GenAI to simplify this work.
